# CS401_02 - Ticket To Ride

See our [Wiki](https://github.com/dSalazar10/Ticket_To_Ride/wiki)!

Ticket To Ride is a board game by [Days of Wonder Boardgames](https://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/).

Our Homework is to design and develop the game using Agile design philosophy, a Model-View-Controller structure, Object Oriented Programming paradigm, and JUnit testing.

We are to collaborate in our team using GIT from inside our IDEs, maintaining our project using a GitHub repository (pull requests, branches, bug reports, etc.).

That concludes our assignment! Each student managed to add over 2,000 lines of code each totaling approximately 6,000 additions. Good job!
